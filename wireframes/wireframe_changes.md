I discussed the design with my parents, and took help from AI to improve this. These are the changes I made:

**Visual stuff:**
- Changed boring solid borders to dashed ones with gradients
- Added shadows and rounded corners to make it look modern
- Better spacing (was way too cramped before)

**Made it interactive:**
- Added proper buttons that look clickable
- Timeline now has actual visual elements instead of just text

**Better organization:**
- Used CSS Grid instead of basic flexbox
- Added JSON badges to show where dynamic content goes
- Mobile frame looks like an actual phone now

**Professional touches:**
- Proper font sizes and hierarchy
- Accessibility notes (parents said this matters for uni)
- Statistics show actual timestamps and context

Basically V1 looked like a rough sketch but V2 looks like something you could actually build from.
